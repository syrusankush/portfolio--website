        Hi, I'm Ankush Yeole! I'm a Student in Sinhgad Institutes of Technology, Lonavala
        pursuing 3<sup>rd</sup> year Computer Engineering. I have competed my High School at Jay Hind College, Dhule. Computer and code was fascinating for me. I was tempted to dive deep into the world of code &  logic. Since in Engineering, my mindset has been ever-evolving to think logically than emotionally.
